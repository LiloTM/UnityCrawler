# UnityCrawler
This is my attempt at the crawler assignment. I've created a crawler, controllable by mouse and keyboard, that can walk up walls by pressing space bar when close to them. A main menu gives the player the controls and leads him into one of two scenes.  
The first scene is the testing grounds that I used to create the actual crawler, while the second one leads into a room I created for further testing. I additionally made an attempt at creating an AI, that would let crawler move freely through the room, yet ran out of time to actually code the scripts.  
Additionally, the crawler can be seen from three perspectives: a static camera in the room, a third person camera, following the crawler around or a first person camera. The third person camera has no mouse movement, as movement by only keyboard is easier for the player.  
A build of the project is in the Assets folder.
